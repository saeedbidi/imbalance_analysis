# Daily Imbalance Reporting System

This project is a daily reporting tool for analysing electricity system imbalance costs and prices using BMRS (Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service) data. The system retrieves imbalance prices and volumes from the BMRS API, processes the data, and generates a detailed report with key metrics such as total daily imbalance cost, average unit rate, and the hour with the highest imbalance volume.
